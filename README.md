# Info

This is the STM32 code for my thesis about testing and verifying chips for reuse (rather than melting them for tiny parts and wasting all the energy expended on manufacturing)

# Run

In root to build, it should all use cores by default
```
make
```

Then to upload the code
```
make upload
```

Then use minicom/screen to read output over uart.
